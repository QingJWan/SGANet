Conventional sound event localization and detection (SELD)
focuses on sound event detection (SED) and direction of
arrival (DOA) estimation, which provide limited spatial information. The 3D SELD task addresses this limitation by
incorporating source distance estimation (SDE). In this paper, we propose a similarity-guided aggregation network
(SGA-Net) for sound event localization and detection with
source distance estimation (3D SELD) that combines the
spectrum-based branch and pre-trained model-based branch.
We design a multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) module for the spectrum-based branch to capture rich acoustic
information and a similarity-guided feature fusion (SGFF)
module that includes a spatial feature transform (SFT) module for effective fusion of intermediate features from both
branches.
